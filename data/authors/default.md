Hey there! I&apos;m Ed :) I am a Data Scientist at
<a href="https://afiniti.com">Afiniti</a> in Washington DC
where my work focuses on Applied Artificial Intelligence. In my
undergrad I completed a double major in Mathematics and Statistics at
<a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a>.

Previously, I was a Data Science Intern, and also a Teaching Assistant
in the <a href="https://cs.ucsb.edu/"> UCSB Computer Science Department</a>.
My current passions lie in studying Deep Learning and its applications.
More casually, I am a massive dweeb for math theory, a connoisseur of
math rock and bedroom pop, and I spend more time than I should playing
JRPGs and watching E-sports.
