Hey there! I&apos;m Ed :)

I am a Data Scientist at [Noom](https://www.noom.com/)
in New york where I focus on Growth. Before this, I was at <a href="https://afiniti.com">Afiniti</a> in Washington DC
where my work focused on Applied Artificial Intelligence. In my
undergrad I completed a double major in Mathematics and Statistics at
<a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a>.
During my time at UCSB, I was a Data Science Intern, and a Teaching Assistant
in the <a href="https://cs.ucsb.edu/"> UCSB Computer Science Department</a>.

My current passions lie in studying Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning and their applications.
More casually, I am a massive dweeb for mathematics, a connoisseur of
math rock and bedroom pop, and I spend more time than I should playing
JRPGs and Souls-like games than I probably should.
